# Encryption and Decryption System using Playfair Cipher and Vigenere Cipher

## Overview

This project implements a simple Encryption and Decryption system using two classic ciphers: Playfair Cipher and Vigenere Cipher. The implementation is done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the development environment is Visual Studio Code. The system allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using both ciphers through a web-based interface.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- **style.css:** The CSS file for styling the web page and providing a user-friendly interface.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file that contains the logic for encrypting and decrypting messages using Playfair and Vigenere ciphers.

## How to Run

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your Chrome browser or any other modern browser.

## Features

- **Playfair Cipher:**
  - Implements the Playfair Cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages.
  - Handles digraphs and maintains the key matrix.

- **Vigenere Cipher:**
  - Implements the Vigenere Cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages.
  - Supports both autokey and repeating key variants.

- **User Interface:**
  - Simple and intuitive user interface for entering messages and keys.
  - Provides options for selecting the cipher type and choosing encryption or decryption.

## Tools Used

- **Visual Studio Code:** Used as the integrated development environment (IDE) for coding.
- **HTML:** Used for creating the structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the web page and ensuring a pleasant user experience.
- **JavaScript:** Used for implementing the logic of the Playfair and Vigenere ciphers.
